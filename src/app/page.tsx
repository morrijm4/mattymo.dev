            <p>
                My name is Matthew Morrison. I am a software engineer, climber, guitarist, and golfer. I live in New York City and I am a student at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/">Cornell Tech</a> earning a Master of Engineering in Computer Science degree.
            </p>
            I let my curiosity and interest direct my ambitions and I pursue my passions with great intensity. I focus on the journey and cherish what I learn from my experiences. I firmly believe I can accomplish anything when my mind is set on a goal.
